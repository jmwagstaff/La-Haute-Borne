# La Haute Borne wind park

## Notes: Some initial questions

Is there a wind direction that produces more power than other? Are all wind 
directions equivalent? If yes, is this because of some geographical feature, 
or because the wind turbines are affecting each other? I.e. are the wind 
turbines affecting each other?

Are all the turbines similar in efficiency? If not, why not? Geography, wind
coverage, other turbines, general condition (might be indicated by factors 
such as temperatures etc.)

Can we find times when maintenance work was done? 

What indicates a turbines ages? Can we predict this? Temperature response at
high wind for example? 

Can we predict the output power from historical weather forecast?

Are people living closer to turbines more likely to buy green energy?
